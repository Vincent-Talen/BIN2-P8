# Introduction
Climate change is a rising threat to the earth, the average overall surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.2°C per decade and up to 2–5°C by the end of this century, leading to massive disruptions at all levels of biological organization across ecosystems. Life-history traits, population dynamics, species interactions and ecological processes are strongly influenced by temperature, especially physiological traits related to energy acquisition and expenditure, such as metabolic rate and ingestion rate, which together determine the energy balance of organisms. Furthermore, most organisms are ectotherms on who temperature has an even greater effect, thus understanding thermal physiology of ectotherms is key in understanding the response of ecosystems to global warming.

A powerful framework to investigate ecosystem functioning in the context of global warming is the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE). It combines the effects of body mass and temperature on biochemical processes in order to predict individual physiological performances, this can then be scaled up from individuals to population, community and ecosystem levels. As metabolic losses increase exponentially with warming, organisms generally increase energy supply through nutrient ingestion, but metabolism increases more rapidly than nutrient ingestion with temperature. This resulting mismatch causes a decreasing energetic efficiency as temperature rises, but has not been studied or measured directly.

Despite the functional significance and vulnerability to warming of detritivore populations, most studies on the impact of global warming on consumer-resource dynamics have mainly focused on carnivore and herbivore populations. Detritivores are heterotrophs that consume plant litter and decompose them into smaller inorganic molecules, performing what is called the first stage of remineralisation. These inorganic compounds can then be used by primary producers, such as plants and algae, to synthesize new organic molecules, completing the nutrient cycle in the ecosystem. Thus, leaf litter decomposition by detritivores is a crucial process in the ecosystem as it allows the nutrients stored in organic matter to be recycled and reused by other organisms.

Previous studies have not yet fully explained how thermal constraints on detritivores scale up to their entire ecosystems. Thermal bio-energetic models are greatly relevant for studying the impact of temperature and body size changes on detritivore-resource dynamics and understanding the balance between key physiological processes that determine detritivore fitness is crucial for predicting the responses of populations and freshwater ecosystems to global warming.

The goal of this research is to improve and expand on the research done by *Réveillon et al.* by greatly improving the model code written in R, resulting in better reproducibility of this research and it being more easily expandable. *Réveillon et al.* investigated the thermal energetic mismatch between energy demand (i.e. metabolic rate) and supply (i.e. ingestion rate) and simulated the consequences of this thermal mismatch for seasonal population dynamics and carbon fluxes.

RMR was calculated as the slope of oxygen depletion over a ca 35 min timeframe, corrected for the mean linear trend over time of oxygen concentration in controls as follows: RMR = (ci – cf)/(ti – tf), where ci and cf are initial and final oxygen concentrations (μmol O2/L) in the wells and ti and tf are initial and final times points (day-1) of the respiration experiment. Values were converted into C release rate (μg C/day) assuming a respiratory coefficient of 0.78 (as estimated for Gammarus pulex, Wright & Wright, 1979).

### Statistical Analysis Equations
The following equations were used to express the mass (M in mg) and temperature (T in Kelvin) dependence of individual RMR and IR:

\mtestandard
\mtequadratic

The standard MTE formulation (\ref{eq:mte_standard}) is simply a particular case of the quadratic formulation (\ref{eq:mte_quadratic}) where $q = 0$ and 
the equation is reduced to the MTE model where p can thus be interpreted as the activation energy.

Energetic efficiency was also calculated as follows: $E = (IR/RMR) * A_T$, where the ratio of IR to RMR is the ingestion to metabolism efficiency and $A_T$ is the assimilation efficiency at temperature $T$. The temperature ($T$ in Kelvin) dependence of assimilation efficiency was expressed, using empirical equations and values for detritivores Assimilation efficiency was following a logistic equation with the MTE equation both at the numerator and the denominator
With the following formulation, assimilation efficiency is confined between 0 and 1 (no or complete assimilation):

# Discussion and Conclusion
## Discussion
<!-- - Compare your results with what is expecting from the literature and discuss differences with them. -->
<!-- - Discuss striking and surprising results. -->
<!-- - Discuss weaknesses in your research and how they could be addressed. -->
- Basically unreproducible in general, long pieces of code that were repeated over and over that could not be understood. No easy way to reproduce other than to immediately copy and paste multiple hundreds lines of code where only few values would be changed.
- Formulas for metabolic and ingestion rates were heavily rewritten from the base formula. They were unrecognizable so they were cleaned up to be understandable and resemble the actual formula more. It should also be noted that the position where the mean in the quadratic portion of the exponent is actually different from what would be done following the formula.
