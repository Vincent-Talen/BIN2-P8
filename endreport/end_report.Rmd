# Introduction
Climate change is a rising threat to the earth, the average overall surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.2°C per decade and up to 2–5°C by the end of this century, leading to massive disruptions at all levels of biological organization across ecosystems *[@Dawson2011; @Walther2002]*. Life-history traits, population dynamics, species interactions and ecological processes are strongly influenced by temperature *[@Dell2011; @Sommer2012; @Woodward2010]*, especially physiological traits related to energy acquisition and expenditure *[@Brown2004]*, such as metabolic rate *[@Dillon2010; @Marshall-McQuaid2011]* and ingestion rate *[@Rall2012; @Vucic-Pestic2011]*, which together determine the energy balance of organisms. Furthermore, most organisms are ectotherms *[@Bickford2011]* on who temperature has an even greater effect *[@Angilletta2002]*, thus a key in understanding ecosystems' response to global warming is understanding the thermal physiology of ectotherms *[@Deutsch2008]*.

A powerful framework to investigate ecosystem functioning in the context of global warming is the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) *[@Brown2004]*. It combines the effects of body mass and temperature on biochemical processes in order to predict individual physiological performances *[@Gillooly2001; @West2003]*, this can then be scaled up from individuals to population, community and ecosystem levels *[@Allen2005]*. As metabolic losses increase exponentially with warming, organisms generally increase energy supply through nutrient ingestion *[@Sentis2012; @Lemoine2014]*, but metabolism increases more rapidly than nutrient ingestion with temperature. The resulting mismatch causes a decreasing energetic efficiency as temperature rises *[@Bideault2021]*, but has not been studied or measured directly.

Despite the functional significance and vulnerability to warming of detritivore populations *[@Boyero2012; @Wenisch2017]*, most studies on the impact of global warming on consumer-resource dynamics have mainly focused on carnivore and herbivore populations. Detritivores are heterotrophs that consume plant litter and decompose them into smaller inorganic molecules, performing what is called the first stage of remineralisation. These inorganic compounds can then be used by primary producers, such as plants and algae, to synthesize new organic molecules, completing the nutrient cycle in the ecosystem. Thus, leaf litter decomposition by detritivores is a crucial process in the ecosystem as it allows the nutrients stored in organic matter to be recycled and reused by other organisms.

Previous studies have not yet fully explained how thermal constraints on detritivores scale up to their entire ecosystems. Thermal bio-energetic models are greatly relevant for studying the impact of temperature and body size changes on detritivore-resource dynamics *[@Bernhardt2018; @Osmond2017; @Sentis2017]* and understanding the balance between key physiological processes that determine detritivore fitness *[@Jabiol2020]* is crucial for predicting the responses of populations and freshwater ecosystems to global warming *[@Bideault2021; @Demars2011; @Yvon-Durocher2010]*.

The goal of this research is to reproduce and improve on the research done by *Réveillon et al. [@Réveillon2022]* on the modelling of the consumer-resource dynamics by greatly improving the model code written in R, resulting in better reproducibility of this research and it being more easily expandable. *Réveillon et al.* investigated the thermal energetic mismatch between energy demand (i.e. metabolic rate) and supply (i.e. ingestion rate) and simulated the consequences of this thermal mismatch for seasonal population dynamics and carbon fluxes *[@Réveillon2022]*.

<!-- (Theory/Model) -->
## Theory
The consumer-resource model created by *Réveillon et al.* describes the seasonal dynamics of *Gammarus Fossarum* and Leaf Litter biomasses in a temperate stream, a diagram showing an overview of the system dynamics can be seen below in Figure \ref{fig:model_diagram}. Even though the model assumes that all individuals of the population have the same body mass, the exploration on the effects of temperature-induced changes in population body size is still possible. The fluctuation in Gammarus population biomass is driven by the balance between carbon intake through food ingestion and carbon loss through respiration. Changes in leaf litter biomass are due to herbivory pressure of Gammarus on seasonal litter fall stock.

```

<!-- (State variables) -->
### State variables
The model has two state variables, leaf litter standing stocks ($L$) and *Gammarus* population biomass ($G$), both in in $mg\:C/m^2$. Both state variables have an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes their temporal change, Equation \ref{eq:odeleaflitter} and \ref{eq:odegammaruspopulation} respectively.

\odeleaflitter
\odegammaruspopulation

The standing stock of leaf litter is sustained by the seasonal leaf litter fall inputs ($I$) and decreases due to feeding activity by the *Gammarus* population ($f(L)_T\:G$) and litter decomposition ($k_T\:L$) by other degradation processes (e.g. microbial decomposition and leaching). Dynamics of the *Gammarus* population is described as the balance of carbon intake through litter ingestion ($f(L)_T\:A_T$) and loss through respiration ($RMR_T$), henceforth Routine Metabolic Rate ($RMR$). Each of the parameters of these two ODEs is described by their own equation and dependent on temperature, except for leaf litter input, all parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:State-Variable-Parameters} below.

| Parameter           | Equation | Unit                              | Explanation
|----                 |---       |-----------                        |--------------------
| $I$                 | -        | $mg\:C \: m^{2}$                  | Leaf litter input
| $f(L)_{\mathrm{T}}$ | 2        | $mg\:C \: mg\:C^{-1} \: day^{-1}$ | Gammarus functional response
| $RMR_{\mathrm{T}}$  | 3b       | $mg\:C/day$                       | Gammarus routine metabolic rate
| $A_{\mathrm{T}}$    | 4        | -                                 | Gammarus assimilation efficiency
| $k_{\mathrm{T}}$    | 5        | $day^{-1}$                        | Leaf litter microbial decomposition
Table: Model state variables' parameters \label{tab:State-Variable-Parameters}

<!-- (Parameters) -->
### Parameter equations
The first parameter that is used in both differential equations is the *Gammarus* population feeding rate, which follows the Holling type II functional response (Equation \ref{eq:hollingtypetwo}).

\hollingtypetwo

with $a_{\mathrm{T}}$ being the *Gammarus* attack rate on leaves ($mg^{-2}/day$), $h_{\mathrm{T}}$ the *Gammarus* handling time ($day^{-1}$), both at temperature $T$, and with $L$ being the leaf litter biomass in $mg\:C/m^2$. Attack rate is estimated by assuming that the proportion of ingested leaf litter follows an exponential decay of time, which can be calculated as $DC_{\mathrm{T}} = -log(1-IR_{\mathrm{T}} * t/M_L)$. Where $IR_{\mathrm{T}}$ is the daily leaf ingestion rate ($IR$) at temperature T ($mg\:C \: mg\:C^{-1} \: day^{-1}$) calculated with Equation \ref{eq:mtequadratic}, $t$ is the duration of the experiment (d) and $M_L$ is the mean initial C mass of leaf discs in microcosms. After the decay rate is calculated the attack rate can finally be calculated by dividing the estimated decay rate by the experimental duration ($a_{\mathrm{T}} = DC_{\mathrm{T}} / t$). The handling time is calculated as the inverse of the ingestion rate ($h_{\mathrm{T}} = 1 / IR_{\mathrm{T}}$).

To express the mass ($M$) and temperature ($T$) dependence of the $RMR$ and $IR$ of individuals the following equations were used:
To express the dependence of $RMR$ and $IR$ of individuals on mass ($M$) and temperature ($T$) the following equations using the MTE formula were used:

\mtestandard
\mtequadratic

where $\alpha$ is the metabolic or the ingestion expression level at reference temperature $T_0$, $b$ is the mass-scaling exponent, $M$ is the dry body mass (mg), $Ea$ is the activation energy (eV) and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant ($8.62 * 10^{-5} \: eV \: K^{-1}$).  
To allow for the investigation into the curvature strength of the relationship between the measured rate (I) and temperature, a deviation of the MTE expression is used within Equation \ref{eq:mtequadratic}'s exponential term. The curvature is described by the fitted polynomial first- and second-order terms `p` and `q`, respectively *[@Englund2011; @Irlich2009]*. If $q = 0$ is used in the quadratic formulation (Equation \ref{eq:mtequadratic}) and the equation is reduced to the MTE model, then `p` can be interpreted as the activation energy *[@Englund2011]*. This particular case is formulated as Equation \ref{eq:mtestandard}.

To express the temperature dependence of assimilation efficiency ($A_T$), empirical equations and values for detritivores from *Lang et al. [@Lang2017]* are used. So the assimilation efficiency is confined between 0 and 1 (no assimilation or complete assimilation) a logistic equation is used where the MTE equation is used both at the numerator and denominator, resulting in Equation \ref{eq:assimilationefficiency}.

\assimilationefficiency

where $\alpha$ is the normalization constant of assimilation efficiency, $Ea$ is the activation energy (eV) and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant ($8.62 * 10^{-5} \: eV \: K^{-1}$).

The temperature dependence of microbial decomposition is expressed using the Arrhenius equation, since carbon fluxes in aquatic ecosystems are largely caused by microbial decomposition *[@Schneider2012]* causing leaf litter to also be affected by this.

\leafdecompositionrate

where $k_{10^{\circ}C}$ is the leaf litter decomposition rate at 10°C (283.15K), $Ea$ is the activation energy (eV) and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant.

# Materials and Methods
## The software model
The model was implemented using the `R` programming language *[@R-base]* (version 4.1.3), in combination with multiple packages/libraries that made it possible to perform the data manipulation and calculations. The table below (Table \ref{tab:Dependencies}) shows the list of packages that were used for this project, including their exact versions. It is recommended to use the exact versions of the packages listed to guarantee compatibility when reproducing this project and model.

| **Software** | **Package** | **Version** |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| R            |             | 4.1.3       |
|              | data.table  | 1.14.2      |
|              | deSolve     | 1.3.4       |
|              | ggpubr      | 0.4.0       |
|              | lme4        | 1.1-29      |
|              | quantmod    | 0.4.20      |
|              | reshape2    | 1.4.4       |
|              | tidyverse   | 1.3.1       |
Table: Software and packages \label{tab:Dependencies}

The `ode` function from the deSolve *[@deSolve2010]* package is the core tool used to implement the model, it applies the ordinary differential equations (ODE), that make up the model, over time with parameters. All the data is placed into `data.table`s from the `data.table` library *[@R-data.table]*, allowing for fast and intuitive operations. To visualize the data and create plots the packages `ggpubr` *[@R-ggpubr]*, `reshape2` *[@R-reshape2]* and `tidyverse` *[@tidyverse2019]* were used. The `lme4` *[@lme42015]* and `quantmod` *[@R-quantmod]* packages were used to create models and prediction data used for the actual lines in the plots.

## Model configuration
*Réveillon et al.* performed multiple laboratory experiments and statistical analyses to estimate values for the initial state variables and the parameters that together accurately describe the dynamics to develop the consumer-resource model *[@Réveillon2022]*. The experimental values that *Réveillon et al.* used will also be used for this project in order to attain the goal of this project, namely to improve on the code implementation of the consumer-resource model. All values below will come from their research article *([@Réveillon2022])*.

Each scenario that has been simulated for this project has been done for the same five temperatures ($5$, $10$, $15$, $20$ and $25$ degrees Celsius) and were run for the same 7-year duration, of which the first year is excluded because of transient dynamics following the input of leaf litter and detritivores in the system. The annual leaf litter fall was represented as an event of 15 consecutive days at the beginning of each year, with an even amount of leaf litter fall each day as to mimic the phenology of forest vegetation in the study region *[@Réveillon2022]*. It was also assumed that each Gammarus individual had the same body mass, meaning that a population size structure was not implemented.

Since the consumer-resource model consists of two state variables and almost each of their parameters are again expressed as equations which also have their own parameters, a lot of values were used to describe and simulate the system dynamics. Most of the equations' parameters are static between scenarios, with only the mass ($M$) and temperature ($T$) changing. The static parameter values will be listed in a separate table for each equation, beginning with the global parameter values used in almost every equation or formula in Table \ref{tab:Global-Parameter-Values}.

| **Parameter**  | **Value**           | **Unit**       | **Explanation**

Table: Global parameter values \label{tab:Global-Parameter-Values}

Both the Metabolic- and Ingestion Rate are both calculated using Equation \ref{eq:mtequadratic}, they thus *do* use the same parameters but *not* the same parameter values. The values that are used to calculate the metabolic rate are listed in Table \ref{tab:Metabolic-Rate-Parameter-Values} and the values used to calculate the ingestion rate are listed in Table \ref{tab:Ingestion-Rate-Parameter-Values}.

Table: Ingestion Rate parameter values \label{tab:Ingestion-Rate-Parameter-Values}

For calculating the assimilation efficiency, estimates provided by *Lang et al. [@Lang2017]* and the rescaled intercept ($\alpha$) by *Réveillon et al. [@Réveillon2022]* were used. These values are listed below in Table \ref{tab:Assimulation-Efficiency-Parameter-Values}.

Table: Assimilation Efficiency parameter values \label{tab:Assimulation-Efficiency-Parameter-Values}

Parameter values used for the attack rate formula can be seen in Table \ref{tab:Attack-Rate-Formula-Parameter-Values}. Initial mass of the leaf discs is derived from the pre-weighed batches of six dry leaf discs the individuals were allowed to feed on during the experiment. The mean dry mass of these batches was $10.25 mg$ *[@Réveillon2022]*, which was then converted from dry mass to C content through the use of the the conversion factor ($0.45$) of dry mass to C content of leaf litter. Lastly the C mass was converted from $mg$ to $μg$ by multiplying by 1000.

Table: Attack rate formula static parameter values \label{tab:Attack-Rate-Formula-Parameter-Values}

The parameter values used in the Arrhenius equation that expresses the microbial decomposition rate of leaf litter are listed in Table \ref{tab:Leaf-Decomposition-Rate-Parameter-Values} and are in situ estimates provided by *Follstad Shah et al. [@Follstad2017]*.

One of the attributes that was calculated as part of the analysis is the annual persistence time above thresholds for both litter standing stock and Gammarus stock, the threshold values that were used are listed in Table \ref{tab:Annual-Persistence-Time-Thresholds}.

| **Threshold**  | **Value**           | **Unit**       | **Explanation**

Table: Annual persistence time threshold values \label{tab:Annual-Persistence-Time-Thresholds}

### Main analysis
For the main analysis three scenarios were simulated, the first was the reference scenario ($TSR_R$) with all its parameters values based on experimental estimates and the Gammarus mean body mass is constant across temperatures. Because body mass is temperature dependent *[@Atkinson1994]* two other scenarios were simulated that implemented the dependency of temperature on body mass, these simulations were based on empirical results from a meta-analysis by *Forster et al. ([@Forster2012])*: a scenario that uses the mean relationship between body mass and temperature for aquatic organisms ($TSR_A$) and a scenario that corresponds to the largest body size decrease with temperature ($TSR_M$). The values used for the main analysis' scenarios are listed below in Table \ref{tab:Main-Analysis-State-Variables-Initial-Values}.

# Results
<!-- Introduction of results, how does it answer your research questions.   -->
By rewriting, restructuring and making the code dynamic through the use of functions, the research has become much better reproducible and verifiable. 
To show the effect of the rewrite two code chunks will be shown, the first of the original code and second of the new code, the most notable change is that the new code is much more comprehensible.
What needs to be mentioned is that for the original code newlines have been added to even fit it inside this report, the actual code is on one single line and even less readable.

# Discussion and Conclusion
## Discussion
<!-- - Compare your results with what is expecting from the literature and discuss differences with them. -->
<!-- - Discuss striking and surprising results. -->
<!-- - Discuss weaknesses in your research and how they could be addressed. -->
- Basically unreproducible in general, long pieces of code that were repeated over and over that could not be understood. No easy way to reproduce other than to immediately copy and paste multiple hundreds lines of code where only few values would be changed.
- Formulas for metabolic and ingestion rates were heavily rewritten from the base formula. They were unrecognizable so they were cleaned up to be understandable and resemble the actual formula more. It should also be noted that the position where the mean in the quadratic portion of the exponent is actually different from what would be done following the formula.

## General conclusion and perspective
<!-- Discuss what your goal was, what the end result is and how you could continue working from here. -->
