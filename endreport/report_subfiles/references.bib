  abstract = {Abstract The balance of energetic losses and gains is of paramount importance for understanding and predicting the persistence of populations and ecosystem processes in a rapidly changing world. Previous studies suggested that metabolic rate often increases faster with warming than resource ingestion rate, leading to an energetic mismatch at high temperature. However, little is known about the ecological consequences of this energetic mismatch for population demography and ecosystem functions. Here, we combined laboratory experiments and modelling to investigate the energetic balance of a stream detritivore Gammarus fossarum along a temperature gradient and the consequences for detritivore populations and organic matter decomposition. We experimentally measured the energetic losses (metabolic rate) and supplies (ingestion rate) of Gammarus and we modelled the impact of rising temperatures and changes in Gammarus body size induced by warming on population dynamics and benthic organic matter dynamics in freshwater systems. Our experimental results indicated an energetic mismatch in a Gammarus population where losses via metabolic rate increase faster than supplies via food ingestion with warming, which translated in a decrease in energetic efficiency with temperature rising from 5 to 20°C. Moreover, our consumer–resource model predicts a decrease in the biomass of Gammarus population with warming, associated with lower maximum abundances and steeper abundance decreases after biomass annual peaks. These changes resulted in a decrease in leaf litter decomposition rate and thus longer persistence of leaf litter standing stock over years in the simulations. In addition, Gammarus body size reductions led to shorter persistence for both leaf litter and Gammarus biomasses at low temperature and the opposite trend at high temperature, revealing that body size reduction was weakening the effect of temperature on resource and consumer persistence. Our model contributes to identifying the mechanisms that explain how thermal effects at the level of individuals may cascade through trophic interactions and influence important ecosystem processes. Considering the balance of physiological processes is crucial to improve our ability to predict the impact of climate change on carbon stocks and ecosystem functions.}

Alarming predictions have come from a rather narrow methodological base, but a new, integrated science of climate-change biodiversity assessment is emerging, based on multiple sources and approaches. Drawing on evidence from paleoecological observations, recent phenological and microevolutionary responses, experiments, and computational models, we review the insights that different approaches bring to anticipating and managing the biodiversity consequences of climate change, including the extent of species’ natural resilience. We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses. Although much of the information reviewed is on species, our framework and conclusions are also applicable to ecosystems, habitats, ecological communities, and genetic diversity, whether terrestrial, marine, or fresh water.}

            diversity of traits (n = 112), species (n = 309), body sizes (15

            rising component of within-species (intraspecific) responses
            reveals that 87\% are fit well by the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model.
            The mean activation energy for these rises is 0.66 $\pm$ 0.05 eV,
            similar to the reported across-species (interspecific) value of
            0.65 eV. However, systematic variation in the distribution of
            rise activation energies is evident, including previously
            unrecognized right skewness around a median of 0.55 eV. This
            skewness exists across levels of organization, taxa, trophic

  abstract = {Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies.}

  abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.}

Temperature rise does not have a linear effect on an organism's biology, and estimated warming-induced changes in metabolic rate for tropical ectotherms are found to be larger than, or equivalent in magnitude to, those observed in temperate climates. This work may have profound implications both locally and globally, because the tropics are an important engine of primary productivity and contain a large proportion of the world's biodiversity.}

Controversy surrounds the model's implication of a mechanistic basis for metabolism that excludes the effects of adaptive regulation, and it is unclear how this would apply to organisms that live in fringe environments and typically show considerable metabolic adaptation. We explored thermal scaling of metabolism in a rocky-shore eulittoral-fringe snail (Echinolittorina malaccana) that experiences constrained energy gain and fluctuating high temperatures (between 25°C and approximately 50°C) during prolonged emersion (weeks). In contrast to the prediction of the UTD model, metabolic rate was often negatively related to temperature over a benign range (30–40°C), the relationship depending on (i) the temperature range, (ii) the degree of metabolic depression (related to the quiescent period), and (iii) whether snails were isolated within their shells. Apparent activation energies (E) varied between 0.05 and −0.43 eV, deviating excessively from the UTD's predicted range of between 0.6 and 0.7 eV. The lowering of metabolism when heated should improve energy conservation in a high-temperature environment and challenges both the theory's generality and its mechanistic basis.}

Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer–resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer–resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.}

However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.°C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator–prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator–prey interactions. This implies that warming of natural ecosystems may dampen predator–prey oscillations thus stabilizing their dynamics. The severe long-term implications; however, include predator starvation due to energetic inefficiency despite abundant resources.}

Graphical and mathematical models describe how the relationship between body temperature and performance, termed the performance function, should evolve in response to the thermal environment. Interspecific comparisons of the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance have revealed that the performance function is evolutionarily labile in some taxa but is more conservative in others. A lack of heritable variation or weak selection on performance may explain the conservation of thermal physiology in certain groups, but evolutionary trade-offs do not appear to have been important constraints. Other aspects of thermal physiology, such as the thermal sensitivity of growth rate, have evolved rapidly in ectotherms. Despite the apparent lability of thermal physiology in some taxa, there is limited evidence that thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology are coadapted.

Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.}

  abstract = {Summary 1 We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. 2 The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3 The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0–30 °C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4 The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0–30 °C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5 The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO2 flux. 6 These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems. 7 Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes.}

  abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important environmental parameters influencing all the biological processes and functions of poikilothermic organisms. Although extensive research has been carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature on animal life histories and to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds as well as the optimal temperatures for survival, development, and reproduction, few studies have investigated links between thermal window, metabolism, and trophic interactions such as predation. We developed models and conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how temperature influences predator--prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional response) using a ladybeetle larva feeding on aphid prey. As predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology, we found that handling time exponentially decreases with warming, but---in contrast with this theory---search rate follows a hump-shaped relationship with temperature. An examination of the model reveals that temperature thresholds for predation depend mainly on search rate, suggesting that predation rate is primarily determined by searching activities and secondly by prey handling. In contrast with prior studies, our model shows that per capita short-term predator--prey interaction strengths and predator energetic efficiency (per capita feeding rate relative to metabolism) generally increase with temperature, reach an optimum, and then decrease at higher temperatures. We conclude that integrating the concept of thermal windows in short- and long-term ecological studies would lead to a better understanding of predator--prey population dynamics at thermal limits and allow better predictions of global warming effects on natural ecosystems.}

Unfortunately, we know relatively little about the effects of temperature on herbivory rates for most insect herbivores in a given community. Evolutionary history, adaptation to local environments, and dietary factors may lead to variable thermal response curves across different species. Here we characterized the effect of temperature on herbivory rates for 21 herbivore-plant pairs, encompassing 14 herbivore and 12 plant species. We show that overall consumption rates increase with temperature between 20 and 30 degrees C but do not increase further with increasing temperature. However, there is substantial variation in thermal responses among individual herbivore-plant pairs at the highest temperatures. Over one third of the herbivore-plant pairs showed declining consumption rates at high temperatures, while an approximately equal number showed increasing consumption rates. Such variation existed even within herbivore species, as some species exhibited idiosyncratic thermal response curves on different host plants. Thus, rising temperatures, particularly with respect to climate change, may have highly variable effects on plant-herbivore interactions and, ultimately, top-down control of plant biomass.}

Yet, there is no general trend or consensus on the magnitude and directions of these effects. To fill this gap, we propose a mechanistic framework based on key biological rates that predicts how temperature influences biomass distribution and trophic control in food webs. We show that these predictions arise from thermal mismatches between biological rates and across trophic levels. We couple our theory with experimental data for a wide range of species and find that warming should lead to top-heavier terrestrial food chains and stronger top-down control in aquatic environments. We then derive predictions for the effects of temperature on herbivory and validate them with data on stream grazers. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of thermal effects on consumer–resource systems which is crucial to better understand the biogeography and the consequences of global warming on trophic dynamics.}

  abstract = {Aim: We tested the hypothesis that shredder detritivores, a key trophic guild in stream ecosystems, are more diverse at higher latitudes, which has important ecological implications in the face of potential biodiversity losses that are expected as a result of climate change. We also explored the dependence of local shredder diversity on the regional species pool across latitudes, and examined the influence of environmental factors on shredder diversity. Location: World-wide (156 sites from 17 regions located in all inhabited continents at latitudes ranging from 67° N to 41 S). Methods: We used linear regression to examine the latitudinal variation in shredder diversity at different spatial scales: alpha (α), gamma (γ) and beta (β) diversity. We also explored the effect of γ-diversity on α-diversity across latitudes with regression analysis, and the possible influence of local environmental factors on shredder diversity with simple correlations. Results: Alpha diversity increased with latitude, while γ- and β-diversity showed no clear latitudinal pattern. Temperate sites showed a linear relationship between γ- and α-diversity; in contrast, tropical sites showed evidence of local species saturation, which may explain why the latitudinal gradient in α-diversity is not accompanied by a gradient in γ-diversity. Alpha diversity was related to several local habitat characteristics, but γ- and β-diversity were not related to any of the environmental factors measured. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that global patterns of shredder diversity are complex and depend on spatial scale. However, we can draw several conclusions that have important ecological implications. Alpha diversity is limited at tropical sites by local factors, implying a higher risk of loss of key species or the whole shredder guild (the latter implying the loss of trophic diversity). Even if regional species pools are not particularly species poor in the tropics, colonization from adjacent sites may be limited. Moreover, many shredder species belong to cool-adapted taxa that may be close to their thermal maxima in the tropics, which makes them more vulnerable to climate warming. Our results suggest that tropical streams require specific scientific attention and conservation efforts to prevent loss of shredder biodiversity and serious alteration of ecosystem processes.}

Here we investigated how loses of more environmentally sensitive detritivores alter the key ecosystem process of leaf litter decomposition in a field experiment in two pristine streams with different local shredder assemblages in the Palatinate forest, south-western Germany. We compared bulk leaf decomposition rate and the leaf processing efficiency of shredders in enclosures containing three shredder diversity treatments, where species loss was simulated based on their climate sensitivity. Litter decomposition rates contrasted markedly between survey sites, with a 33\% increase and 41\% decrease in decomposition following species loss at the first and second site, respectively. Results for the first site suggest that the least sensitive taxa, which were also larger in biomass, contributed most to leaf mass loss, and these were able to compensate for losses of sensitive species, ultimately increasing bulk leaf processing. By contrast, at the second site sensitive species played a more important role in litter decomposition and their loss was not compensated when accounting for detritivore biomass. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the species trait composition of local species pools in regulating the potential effects of changes in assemblage composition caused by climate change.}

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.}

There is also widespread empirical evidence for the temperature-size rule (TSR), which creates a negative relationship between temperature and body size. However, it is not known how the TSR affects community dynamics. Here we integrate temperature- and size-dependent models to include indirect effects of warming, through changes in body size, to answer the question, How does the TSR affect the predicted response of consumer-resource systems to warming? We find that the TSR is expected to maintain consumer-resource biomass ratios and buffer the community from extinctions under warming. While our results are limited to conditions where organisms are below their thermal optimum, they hold under a range of realistic temperature-size responses and are robust to the type of functional response. Our analyses suggest that the widely observed TSR may reduce the impacts of warming on consumer-resource systems.}

However, ecological consequences of temperature-size (TS) responses for community persistence under environmental change remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of warming, enrichment, community size structure and TS responses on a three-species food chain using a temperature-dependent model with empirical parameterisation. We found that TS responses often increase community persistence, mainly by modifying consumer-resource size ratios and thereby altering interaction strengths and energetic efficiencies. However, the sign and magnitude of these effects vary with warming and enrichment levels, TS responses of constituent species, and community size structure. We predict that the consequences of TS responses are stronger in aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, especially when species show different TS responses. We conclude that considering the links between phenotypic plasticity, environmental drivers and species interactions is crucial to better predict global change impacts on ecosystem diversity and stability.}

  abstract = {Abstract Temperature is known to stimulate metabolism with cascading effects on multiple biological processes. These effects may, however, vary across processes, types of organisms or levels of biological organisation. They can also vary with nutrient availability, with potentially stronger temperature effects when nutrients are not limiting. This context dependence of temperature effects on processes challenges our ability to anticipate their consequences on ecosystems in a changing world. In headwater streams, the decomposition of allochthonous leaf litter, driven by both microbial decomposers and invertebrates, is known to respond to both temperature and nutrient availability. These food webs are highly tractable and a useful model system to investigate the variations of temperature effects on processes across types of organisms (microbes versus invertebrates), resource availability levels (nutrient concentration), and levels of biological organisation (from individual to ecosystem). In a microcosm experiment, we measured the effects of temperature and nitrogen availability (four levels each) on respiration rates of litter-consuming microbes and invertebrates and their decomposition activity in different contexts of food web complexity. The latter included one treatment without invertebrate detritivore (microbial decomposers only), three single invertebrate taxa (Gammarus, Potamophylax, and Sericostoma) treatments, and one mixed invertebrate taxa treatment (three-species altogether). Microbial processes increased nearly exponentially with temperature (Arrhenius model, activation energy (± 95\% confidence interval) = 0.56 ± 0.53 and 1.00 ± 0.23 eV for litter decomposition and respiration), while invertebrate-driven processes increased (activation energy from 0.47–1.15 eV) up to a maximal value at an intermediate temperature (c. 11–15°C depending on species and process), above which process rates decreased. By contrast, litter consumption in mixed invertebrate species treatments was not significantly influenced by temperature, because of a negative effect of species mixing occurring above 12°C. Nitrogen had a weaker influence, only slightly stimulating litter consumption by mixed-species invertebrates, which limited the scope for synergies with temperature effects. Our results raise issues about how aquatic litter consumers meet their energy requirements at high temperature and suggest that a general consequence of warming could be loss of carbon through mineralisation in headwater stream food webs. In several aspects, our results deviate from expectations based on universal relationships between temperature and individual metabolism (e.g. metabolic theory of ecology), suggesting that we may need to develop less simplistic assumptions to predict the consequence of warming on ecosystem processes.}

  abstract = {1. It is becoming increasingly clear that fresh waters play a major role in the global C cycle. Stream ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) exert a significant control on organic carbon fluxes in fluvial networks. However, little is known about how climate change will influence these fluxes. 2. Here, we used a ‘natural experiment’ to demonstrate the role of temperature and nutrient cycling in whole-system metabolism (ER, GPP and net ecosystem production – NEP), in naturally heated geothermal (5–25°C) Icelandic streams. 3. We calculated ER and GPP with a new, more accurate method, which enabled us to take into account the additional uncertainties owing to stream spatial heterogeneity in oxygen concentrations within a reach. ER ranged 1–25 g C m^{−2} day^{−1} and GPP 1–10 g C m^{−2} day^{−1}. The median uncertainties (based on 1 SD) in ER and GPP were 50\% and 20\%, respectively. 4. Despite extremely low water nutrient concentrations, high metabolic rates in the warm streams were supported by fast cycling rates of nutrients, as revealed from inorganic nutrient (N, P) addition experiments. 5. ER exceeded GPP in all streams (with average GPP/ER =0.6) and was more strongly related to temperature than GPP, resulting in elevated negative NEP with warming. We show that, as a first approximation based on summer investigations, global stream carbon emission to the atmosphere would nearly double from 0.12 Pg C year^{−1} at 13°C to 0.21 (0.15–0.33) Pg C year^{−1} with a 5°C warming. 6. Compared to previous studies from natural systems (including terrestrial ecosystems), the temperature dependence of stream metabolism was not confounded by latitude or altitude, seasonality, light and nutrient availability, water chemistry, space availability (water transient storage), and water availability. 7. Consequently, stream nutrient processing is likely to increase with warming, protecting downstream ecosystems (rivers, estuaries, coastal marine systems) during the summer low flows from nutrient enrichment, but at the cost of increased CO2 flux back to the atmosphere.}

However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO2 at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2. Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services.}
